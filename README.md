# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alexander, a software developer who read the map wrong but finally found my way to Australia. Some places I ended up in include China, Southern Africa, and England, where Iâ€™ve picked up not just my current set of skills but a lot of stories along the way. Each stop has shaped how I tackle problems and come up with creative solutions, blending all those experiences into my work today.

## Tools I Use

| Libraries & Frameworks  | Back-End       | Databases     | DevOps & Tools             |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| JavaScript (ES6+)       | Node.js        | MongoDB       | Git                        |
| React.js                | Express        | PostgreSQL    | GitHub                     |
| React Native            | REST APIs      | SQL           | Command-Line Interface(CLI)|
| Expo                    | GraphQL        |               | Vite                       |
| TypeScript              | WebSockets     |               | Jest                       |

## My Approach

Fail fast, and if your approach isn't working, do it again and fail faster. Rinse and repeat till your brain hurts, then have a cup of tea and realize you had it right the first time or stumble upon a much easier solution. Itâ€™s all part of the process, right?

## About Me

Iâ€™m the guy whoâ€™s got a million thoughts running through his head at once, sometimes to the point of needing a mental reboot. But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve learned how to keep it together. Iâ€™m your go-to when you need someone who can crack a joke at just the right moment or give you a hand fixing your tie before you meet the queen. The routine stuff gets sorted out one way or the other, usually after an "uh-oh" moment and practicing like mad for a week, then we're good! In the end, more "uh-oh" moments just mean more chances to learn quickly, so to speak.
